description: There were times when we had to go without puddings to pay John's uniform
  bills, and always I did the facings myself with a cloth-ball to save getting new
  ones. I would have polished his sword, too, if I had been allowed; I adored his
  sword. And once, I remember, we painted and varnished our own dog-cart, and very
  smart it looked, to save fifty rupees. We had nothing but our pay John had his company
  when we were married, but what is that? and life was made up of small knowing economies,
  much more amusing in recollection than in practise.
